/**
 * Active Player Definition — Central Configuration
 *
 * This file defines who counts as an "active player" toward operator subscription
 * tier eligibility. All knobs live here so the definition is easy to tune without
 * hunting through controllers.
 *
 * Definition (as of April 2026):
 * A roster member of a hall is an "active player" if ALL are true:
 *   - They are on the hall's active roster
 *   - Their account is in good standing (not banned, not suspended)
 *   - Their email is verified (prevents placeholder/bot accounts)
 *   - Their account is older than MIN_ACCOUNT_AGE_HOURS (prevents last-minute stuffing)
 *   - They have a recorded activity timestamp within ACTIVITY_WINDOW_DAYS
 *
 * Qualifying activities that update `users.lastActivityAt`:
 *   - Successful login (password or OAuth)
 *   - Signup (bootstrapped to now)
 *   - Creating or accepting a challenge
 *   - Creating or submitting a match
 *   - Joining a tournament
