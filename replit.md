## Where things live

*   `/src/` - Frontend source code
*   `/server/` - Backend source code
*   `/mobile/` - React Native mobile app source code
*   `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema (PostgreSQL)
*   `server/controllers/financial.controller.ts` - Stripe price ID configuration
*   `server/middleware/auth.ts`, `server/replitAuth.ts` - API Authentication guards
*   `server/services/rackPointsService.ts` - Rack Points service logic
*   `server/services/notifyService.ts` - In-app notification fire-and-forget helpers
*   `server/routes/me.routes.ts` - Authenticated `/api/me/*` routes (rack points, notifications)
*   `server/utils/ownership.ts` - Ownership helper functions for IDOR fixes
*   `server/utils/SafeText.ts` - Language sanitization logic
*   `src/components/SafeText.tsx` - React component for language sanitization

## Architecture decisions

*   **Credit-based Challenge Pool**: Implemented with pre-funding and tiered service fees to prevent "ghosting" and encourage commitment.
*   **AI Billiards Coach**: Utilizes Dr. Dave's physics rules to provide granular shot analysis and improvement insights.
*   **Three-tier Authentication**: Supports Creator/Owner, Operator, and Player roles with distinct access levels, including 2FA for Creators.
*   **Language Sanitization**: Automatic system to replace gambling-related terms with league-safe terminology, enforced via middleware.
*   **WebView Mobile App**: Uses React Native with Expo as a WebView wrapper for the web app, integrating native features like camera for OCR and push notifications.
*   **In-app Notifications**: New `notifications` table separate from `notificationDeliveries` (which tracks outbound email/SMS provider routing). `notifyService` is the single chokepoint — all helpers fire-and-forget via `safeCreate` so a failed notification never blocks the primary write. Client polls `/api/me/notifications` every 30s; cache key is scoped to the current user id to prevent leak across logout/login.
*   **No fabricated UI defaults**: Components must never invent stat values (player names, ratings, ranks, opponents, dates) when API data is missing. Render a neutral placeholder (`—`) instead. Showing a fake `Mike Chen` or `Fargo 425` to users whose data hasn't loaded is worse than showing nothing — it looks like real data.

## User preferences

*   **Communication Style**: Concise, professional, no emojis in code
*   **Code Style**: TypeScript strict mode, functional components, proper error handling
*   **Theme**: Dark mode preferred, green accent colors for billiards aesthetic

## Gotchas

*   **Stripe Price IDs**: Hardcoded in `server/controllers/financial.controller.ts`. Do not rely on environment variables for these.
*   **API Authentication**: All new routes must have explicit authentication guards. Public exceptions require comments with justification.
*   **Ownership Checks**: User-specific data access requires `requireSelfOrStaff` or `requireSelfPlayerOrStaff` to prevent IDOR vulnerabilities.
*   **Wallet Top-Up Hardening**: `completeTopUp` verifies Stripe PaymentIntent metadata for integrity.
*   **Email Verification**: New user signups require email verification unless they use OAuth or are Owner/Staff.
*   **Notification calls are fire-and-forget**: Always call `notifyService` helpers without `await`. Errors are swallowed inside `safeCreate`. Never let a notification failure rollback or block a primary action.
*   **Notification cache key must include user id**: Per-user query keys prevent cached notifications from leaking across login transitions. Use `notificationsKey(currentUserId)` if adding new mutations.
