## User Preferences
- **Communication Style**: Concise, professional, no emojis in code

## System Architecture
The system is built on a modern web stack designed for performance, scalability, and a unique user experience.

### UI/UX Decisions

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, and TanStack Query for data fetching.
- **Backend**: Express.js, primarily utilizing in-memory storage (MemStorage) with a PostgreSQL database available for persistent data.
- **Mobile App**: React Native with Expo, functioning as a WebView wrapper for the web application, incorporating native features like camera access for OCR, push notifications, and location services.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom dark theme.
- **Challenge Pool System**: Features credit-based entries, wallet management, configurable challenge markets, automated resolution, and a transaction ledger. Includes anti-ghosting protection via pre-funding and a tiered service fee structure.
- **AI Billiards Coach**: Integrates Dr. Dave's physics rules for shot analysis, provides insights on overdraw, spin bias, break accuracy, and other techniques. It includes a scoring formula for improvement and monthly leaderboards.
- **Authentication**: A three-tier system with Creator/Owner, Operator, and Player roles, supporting password login and 2FA for Creator accounts.
- **Language Sanitization**: An automatic system replaces gambling terms with league-safe terminology across the application, enforced via middleware and a SafeText React component.
- **Live Streaming**: Multi-platform integration (Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Kick) with geographic filtering and stream categories.

## Recent Changes (Session Notes)

### Ladder Page Standardization
- All three ladder pages (9ft LadderPage, 8ft EightFootLadderPage, 7ft BarboxLadderPage) now share consistent structure: Hero → Challenger Handicap → Top 3 Podium → Contenders/Elite divisions → Games → CTA
- MembershipDisplay, pricing, and subscription upsells removed from all ladder pages (membership info belongs only in registration: PlayerSubscriptionTiers, Signup, SelectRole)
- WeightRulesDisplay (challenger handicap) improved with plain-English 3-tier explanation, present on all 3 pages
- App.tsx imports 9ft ladder from `@/pages/LadderPage` (not `@/components/ladder`)
- "Kiddie Box King" dev notes added — humorous name for 7ft table, NOT related to children

### Bug Fixes
- SafeText.tsx: Guard against undefined/non-string `children` in `sanitizeText()` (was crashing `/player/career`)
- Fixed `<a>` inside `<Link>` nesting in OwnerLogin.tsx, TrusteeLogin.tsx, ForgotPassword.tsx (wouter v2 renders its own `<a>`)
- 404 page: Replaced developer text with user-friendly message + dark theme styling
- Privacy page: Updated email from `privacy@tricityladder.com` to `privacy@actionladder.com`
- Branding: Header.tsx → "ACTIONLADDER BILLIARDS", Footer.tsx → "Action Ladder Billiards", Landing.tsx footer year → 2025

### Revenue Split
- 23% Founder, 33% Operator, 43% Player Prize Pool, 1% Platform Ops

### Challenger Fee Model
- Rookie = $0/match, Standard = $60/match, Premium = $60/match

### /join Page
- `/join` route added — renders an info page directing users to `/signup` (no backend queue API yet)
- JoinPage shows 3-step flow: Create Account → Pick Table Size → Start Competing
- "Create Account" button links to `/signup`, "Sign In" button links to `/login`
- "Join the Queue" button on 9ft LadderPage navigates to `/join`
- Queue API (`POST /api/player-queue`) not yet implemented — can be added later when needed
